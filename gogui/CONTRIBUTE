Patches for fixing bugs in GoGui are always welcome. Patches that add
a significant amount of functionality should first be discussed with the
author.

The copyright holder of GoGui is Markus Enzenberger. By sending a patch, you
implicitely transfer the copyright on the patch to him. In countries where a
copyright transfer is not possible, you give him unrestricted permission to
use your code in any way, including changing the license of future
versions of GoGui or offering it under multiple licenses.

Larger patches should:

- be written using best coding practices
- be well tested (if possible with unit tests in test/sunit/src)
- respect the existing formatting and coding style of the existing code
- not contain tab-characters
- be submitted as a diff (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) to the source
  in the main branch of the SVN repository
